# Why use Room Booker?
Does the following situation sound familiar to you?
- Your company uses Slack for their internal communication.
- You have one or more meeting rooms that are not well managed.
- A system like Joan or Logitech Tap is far too expensive.
- You like hosting things locally and being in control of your data.

Then Room Booker is the perfect free and open source solution for you!

# Requirements for running Room Booker
To start using Room Booker you'll need the following things:
- A Slack workspace.
- A place on your local network to run a Docker container.
- A small display that you can mount next to a room (those 7-inch 1024x600 ones work well).
- A computer running Linux (preferred) or Windows that you can permanently hook up to the small display. It doesn't need much, so something like a small NUC works. I'm currently working on adding Raspberry Pi support so stay tuned for that!
